## Question
Explain the fundamental difference between `let`/`const` and `var` concerning lexical environment creation and variable hoisting, specifically addressing what happens when a variable is accessed before its declaration within a loop context.

## My Answer
var

Hoisted to the Function Environment Record (FER).

Initialized to undefined immediately during creation phase.

Has no Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

When accessed before declaration → returns undefined, not an error.

let / const

Hoisted to the Block Lexical Environment (Block ER).

Created during the environment’s creation phase but NOT initialized.

Enter the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) from the start of the block until the actual declaration is executed.

## AI Feedback
This explanation is technically accurate, correctly identifying the difference in hoisting scope (Function vs. Block) and the crucial role of immediate initialization (var) versus the uninitialized state leading to the Temporal Dead Zone (let/const). Pro-Tip: While this covers the core difference, remember that in a `for` loop, `let` also creates a new lexical environment for *each iteration*, which is key to avoiding classic closure pitfalls that occur when using `var`.
