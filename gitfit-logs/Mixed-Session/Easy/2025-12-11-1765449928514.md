## Question
Explain the fundamental structural difference between an Array and a Singly Linked List that dictates why accessing the element at index 'k' is O(1) for an Array, but requires O(k) time complexity for a Singly Linked List.

## My Answer
```text
Array

Stored in contiguous memory.

Every element has a fixed-size slot.

The address of any element can be computed directly using:

address = base_address + (k * element_size)


This allows the CPU to jump instantly to index k.

➡️ Therefore, accessing index k is O(1)
```

## AI Feedback
The explanation provided for Array access (O(1)) using contiguous memory and direct address calculation is accurate and highly detailed. However, the answer is incomplete as it fails to explain the corresponding structural reason why Singly Linked List access requires O(k) time complexity (sequential traversal via pointers).
