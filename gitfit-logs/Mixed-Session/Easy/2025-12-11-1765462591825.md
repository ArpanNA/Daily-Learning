# GitFit Challenge: Mixed-Session

## Question
Look closely at the following JavaScript snippet. You must understand how JavaScript handles the '+' operator when mixing different data types. Unlike the minus ('-') operator, plus ('+') acts as both an addition operator and a string concatenation operator. Once the engine sees a string in a sequence of additions, it often defaults to 'gluing' everything together (coercion). What exact value will be logged to the console?

javascript
let x = "10";
let y = 5;
let z = 2;
let output = x + y + z;
console.log(output);


## My Answer
```text
1052
```

## AI Feedback
The answer is correct. JavaScript evaluates the '+' operator from left to right. Since the initial variable 'x' is a string, the engine coerces all subsequent numeric values (y and z) into strings for concatenation.
