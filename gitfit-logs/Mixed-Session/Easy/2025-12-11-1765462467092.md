# GitFit Challenge: Mixed-Session

**Date:** 2025-12-11
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Type:** Code Output
**Time Taken:** 38s

## Question
Analyze the following JavaScript code snippet. This tests your understanding of how JavaScript handles mixing different data types, specifically strings and numbers, when using the addition operator ('+'). Think of it like a strict bouncer at a club: if one item in the calculation is a string, JavaScript treats everything as a string to maintain consistency, prioritizing concatenation over mathematical addition.

javascript
let a = "10";
let b = 5;
let result = a + b;
console.log(result);


What is the exact output displayed by `console.log(result)`?

## My Answer
```text
105
```

## AI Feedback
Excellent. The output '105' is correct. This demonstrates a strong understanding of JavaScript's addition operator ('+') precedence, where the presence of a string operand forces type coercion and string concatenation over arithmetic addition.
