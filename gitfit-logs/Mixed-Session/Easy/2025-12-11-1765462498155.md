## Question
In JavaScript, the '+' operator behaves differently depending on the data types involved. When combining a number and a string, JavaScript converts the number to a string and performs concatenation (gluing) instead of standard mathematical addition. This is known as 'type coercion'. 

What is the final output of this code snippet?

javascript
let x = 10;
let y = "2";
let result = x + y;
console.log(result);


## My Answer
```text
102
```

## AI Feedback
This answer is correct. When the '+' operator is used with a number and a string in JavaScript, the number is coerced into a string, and concatenation occurs, resulting in the string '102'.
